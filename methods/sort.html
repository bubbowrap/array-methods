 //coming back to this later; logic is a bit more than I can wrap my head around atm.

//SUMMARY:

// sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.

// PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION:

function sort(array, compareFunction) {
  var newArray = [];
  var arrayLength = array.length;
  //if compareFunc, for loop with callback/compare func
    for (var i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
      if(compareFunction(array[i])) {
        if 
        newArray.push(array[i]);
      }
    }


  return newArray;
}

//FUNCTION SIGNATURE (the way we want it to be called):

// sort(array, compareFunction);


//RETURN VALUE:

// The sorted array. Note that the array is sorted in place, and no copy is made.


//REQUIREMENTS:

// should return an array
// should accept a callback/compare function to define sort order
// If compare function omitted, should convert array lements to strings and according to character's unicode code point value
// should accept a first + second element to the compare function
// In a numeric sort, 9 comes before 80, but because numbers are converted to strings, "80" comes before "9" in the Unicode order. 
// All undefined elements are sorted to the end of the array.
// If compareFunction(a, b) is less than 0, sort a to an index lower than b (i.e. a comes first).
// If compareFunction(a, b) returns 0, leave a and b unchanged with respect to each other, but sorted with respect to all different elements.
// If compareFunction(a, b) is greater than 0, sort b to an index lower than a (i.e. b comes first).
// compareFunction(a, b) must always return the same value when given a specific pair of elements a and b as its two arguments.
// If inconsistent results are returned, then the sort order is undefined.
// The sort method can be conveniently used with function expressions:
// if empty, just return the empty array
// It should be mutable (returns sorted array)

//ALSO/EDGE CASES

//COME BACK TO:

// see what it does for NaN and holes
// write throw error if not array
